Throughout his 70-plus years in the business, the writer and producer brought topics like racism, abortion, divorce, drug use, and poverty to prime time. Zeitgeist-defining shows including All in the Family, The Jeffersons, One Day at a Time, Maude, and Good Times aimed to entertain and educate while countering the growing right-wing Christian influence on showbiz in the ’70s and ’80s. Today, Lear remains as prolific as ever, producing original series and films, rebooting his greatest hits, underwriting documentaries, and occasionally acting.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl63stnyt001p3b6virdbq6mb@published data-word-count=51>July 27, 2022, marks Lear’s 100th birthday. To celebrate this milestone, 19 of his friends and collaborators — including actors, writers, producers, and executives — shared their favorite stories of his endless imagination and curiosity, willingness to break boundaries, sense of fairness and patriotism, and, of course, mischievous sense of humor.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl63lmhyn006b3b6syvchxktq@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Norman the Career-Maker</span></h2><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl63lmi6j006c3b6sokg38efz@published>“It’s like a fairy tale”</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl63lmhok003q3b6s6e64trf2@published data-word-count=76>I was performing stand-up at the second annual Media Access Awards in 1980, and Norman and Charlotte Rae were in the audience. I got a standing ovation for my routine. I was brought to meet Norman, and he said, “You’re a really funny kid, but you’re way before your time.” I said, “So wait a couple of months.” Two and a half months later, he cast me in Facts of Life. It’s like a fairy tale.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl63lmhps003r3b6slu2mu4on@published data-word-count=96>In 1982, he hired me to do a special called I Love Liberty. It was a huge show with Christopher Reeve, Barbra Streisand, Robin Williams. There was an audience of thousands, and I was the only newbie. It was petrifying. I walked up three flights of stairs, on crutches, to center stage to represent the American Disabled Person. I went into my comedy routine, and nobody laughed. I was pouring sweat. I had tears in my eyes and I dropped the crutches, which was really dramatic, and said, “You know what? I think I need help.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl63lmhpt003s3b6se8vkvuoy@published data-word-count=57>Everybody was staring at me. Norman came running down from the control booth and up onto the stage. He put his arms around my shoulders and said, “Geri, are you okay, sweetheart?” I said, “Norman, I’m fine, but the material sucks.” He put his hands on me and said, “Geri, your mic wasn’t on.” Nobody heard anything.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl63lmhpt003t3b6syntb4kpl@published data-word-count=59>All the celebrities thought he’d just walk me off stage and I’d be cut from the final show, but Norman did the opposite. He got a working mic and asked the audience, “How many people in here want to give this girl a second chance?” I got a standing ovation, and he let me do the whole thing over.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl63lmhpu003u3b6s5u4f5frz@published data-word-count=97>Norman has been a surrogate dad for me throughout the years. He is always funny and always catches you off guard. My friend David Zimmerman and I interviewed him for Ability magazine, and that was also right around his birthday. We knew his favorite dessert was cheesecake from a deli in Westwood, so we got him the cake and we’re singing “Happy Birthday,” and instead of using his fork, he put his whole hand in the cake and put it in his mouth. It was so unexpected. —<strong>Geri Jewell </strong>(played Geri Tyler on The Facts of Life)</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl63lmi7p006d3b6si4vhhmwr@published>“Norman Lear is going to call you, and you have to act surprised”</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl63lmhpu003v3b6sw1szmfan@published data-word-count=90>When it came to 704 Hauser, Reuben Cannon was the casting director who had hired me in Amen and he said that Norman was doing a new show and that Isabel Sanford was going to be the lead, but they were looking for a neighbor and I would be perfect. I was doing theater in New York, and I couldn’t meet with Norman and I apologized. When the show finished, I flew back to L.A. and Reuben had left a message: “Norman Lear is looking for Lynnie. For the lead.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl63lmhpu003w3b6s3sxo6yjn@published data-word-count=61>I made an appointment. I was sitting on a bench by myself. Norman came down the hall, in his little white hat, surrounded by four people. He looked at me and said something to his line producer, who nodded. I later asked him on the set what he had said. It was, “She’s pretty, so I sure hope she can act.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl63lmhpv003x3b6s86eluugv@published data-word-count=112>We go in, and he started talking about the show. He had such great vision about what he wanted to do. He wanted Rose Cumberbatch to be a religious woman. I asked, “What religion?” Norman said, “What?” I said, “Black people belong to a lot of different churches from Protestant to Pentecostal; my family was Pentecostal. Do you know what that means?” He said, “No, tell me.” And we had a whole conversation about it, and I realized because I was so specific about what I wanted this character to be and I was patterning her after my own mother, that I knew more about Rose than he did at that point.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl63lmhpy003y3b6sm3jougme@published data-word-count=56>My agent calls and says, “Norman Lear is going to call you, and you have to act surprised. He is signing you, not the network.” He liked to give the good news to people. Later that night, Norman called, and I acted surprised. So this is going to be the first time he heard about that.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl63lmhpz003z3b6s4lvhlcvx@published data-word-count=35>On the set, it took me two weeks to call him Norman. It was “Mr. Lear.” He’d say, “Everyone should call me Norman.” And I’d say, “Nor … Mr. Lear.” But then I got there.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl63lmhpz00403b6s87mr6e6a@published data-word-count=141>Norman taught me a lot. One thing is about being genuine and transparent. I’d visit him in his office, and one time his receptionist was going out to a store. The phone started to ring; as an actress I’d worked as a receptionist before, so I asked Norman if he wanted me to answer the phone and say, “Good afternoon, this is the office of Norman Lear.” He said, “No, I’ll get it,” and he picked the phone and just said “This is Norman,” and you could tell the other person was saying, “Wait, what?” Sometimes he could help the person calling, sometimes he could not, but he taught me that when someone calls you or emails you or texts you, answer them. Even if you can’t do anything for them or are just saying, “I’m not interested,” just answer everyone.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl63lmhq000413b6s7css0xeu@published data-word-count=143>It was such a lovely experience being with Norman. He decided he wanted to create an aura about me. He’d take me places and introduce me as “the star of 704 Hauser,” and people wouldn’t know what he was talking about. I remember being invited to his house because he wanted to show his friends the pilot, and he said, “I want you to come and meet my friends.” I thought it would just be a couple of actors. I walked in the door and said, “Oh my Lord.” There was Gregory Peck and his wife, Quincy Jones, Maya Angelou. I felt so privileged that he invited me and introduced me to these people. I said, “Hello Mr. Peck,” and he said, “Call me Gregory,” and I said to myself, Yeah, right. Come on now. —<strong>Lynnie Godfrey</strong> (played Rose Cumberbatch on 704 Hauser)</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl63lmi91006e3b6slw6genek@published>“You’re in, kiddo”</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl63lmhq000423b6sphesr5lk@published data-word-count=97>I went to audition for 704 Hauser, but that week I had lost out on a part in Crimson Tide, a Taco Bell commercial that would have paid a hundred grand to shoot for two weeks in Hawaii, and a Diane English show. So I hadn’t even read the 704 Hauser script, even though I never told Norman that. That day I got a call from a friend from Chicago that her brother had just OD’d. I sat and bawled my eyes out, and I had to snap out of it and read the script right quick.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl63lmhq100433b6s2fvqm18a@published data-word-count=88>I go in for the audition, and Norman is sitting in the middle with the producer and the casting directors. I auditioned, but after that week and that morning, I rushed out thinking I wouldn’t get the part. But Norman says, “Wait. Can we talk to you?” He asked where I was from and some questions about my experiences, and he said something I’ve never forgotten: “This is a true case of an actor being better than my words. I’d like to thank you for coming in here.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl63lmhq100443b6s6wsl28ct@published data-word-count=87>But after the pilot, Jeff Sagansky and Peter Tortorici at CBS wanted to fire me. I was 22 or so and they thought I looked older than the character; I had a receding hairline with them Sam Jackson cowlicks. After the pilot, I shot a USA Network movie of the week and shaved my head bald for that. When I saw Norman in the production offices afterwards, he said, “Kiddo, where’s your fucking hair?” He always called me “kiddo.” I said, “It grows back quickly, trust me.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl63lmhq200453b6s8v65jq3m@published data-word-count=85>Then a week later he called and said, “Kiddo, I have good news and bad news. The good news is they picked up the show. The bad news is they want me to fire you.” They made Norman audition other actors. I went into a funk. I was depressed, I wasn’t eating. I was having my major shot yanked out from under me. Finally, I called Norman and they patched me right through, and I asked if I could get a shot at auditioning too.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl63lmhq300463b6sk9v8gw1a@published data-word-count=90>Norman realized I was willing to fight for my job. He threw the resources of his company behind me. I would go in and read the new material with John Amos, [director] Jack Shea, and Norman and then Norman would go back and retool everything with the writers, and he’d tailor the material to my strengths. We did that for three days. Then he says, “Shave all your hair off again.” When I’m bald, I look younger. Now I’m completely bald, and I still get carded going to buy booze.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl63lmhq300473b6sidgbrsee@published data-word-count=65>I go in and do my thing with John Amos the next day and walk out. About ten minutes later, I hear Norman saying, “Where’s kiddo?” And he walks into the room with that famous hat cocked on the side with his arms open and says, “You’re in, kiddo.” I’m choking up just thinking about that. —<strong>T.E.

You walk into his office, and it’s pictures of him with some of the most famous, most powerful people in the world, and yet to sit opposite him is to have his full attention. I was so moved, so struck by how present he was and how, in that moment, I was the most important person in the world to him.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl63lmhq400493b6sxd6vzsxl@published data-word-count=146>Once I was there for half an hour and he said, “Well, we’re thinking about doing the show.” I was like, “Honestly, I don’t know that you should.” He goes, “What? Why not?” I said, “Because people come in and try to make content for Latinos, and we are not a monolith. We are a really diverse group of people, and when people try to make stuff for us, we feel when it’s inauthentic. When you finally get something and it’s not what you are, it’s hard because you want to be seen so badly.” He said, “Well, what do you think we could do to combat that?” I said, “I’m going to speak for this Latina in this family in this city and be super-specific. Hopefully that specificity will ring universal.” He was like, “Well, let’s just do that.” He made it sound so easy.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl63lmhq5004a3b6sq4irijym@published data-word-count=134>Over the course of our time together, he convinced me that in doing this with him, I would be in very, very safe hands. I had been a journeyman writer for many years on other shows, I’d been trying to find the right time and place to tell my story, and Norman not only heard me but said, “I will champion you every day.” And he did. When we would be on set those first episodes, people would go to him or go to Mike Royce and they would both say, “Don’t ask us, ask her.” I’d never been in a situation where that had happened. The spotlight was on them, and they shifted it over to the point where I was able to take up space in a way that changed my life.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl63lmhq6004b3b6s5ij7kh7e@published data-word-count=53>When we shot the pilot, it was very emotional. My parents were there. Rita Moreno was wearing a wig to look like my mother. My parents came here in 1962 from another country, and they learned how to speak English by watching Norman Lear shows. The full circle of that night was tremendous.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl63lmhq7004c3b6sxtliarpb@published data-word-count=79>I got really emotional with Norman. I was like, “Thank you, sir, for changing my life.” He kissed me on the forehead and said, “Oh, Gloria, it was just a matter of time.” What spoke to me about that moment is that even in complimenting him — and people compliment him all the time — he will always reverse the spotlight. That’s just who he is. —<strong>Gloria Calderón Kellett </strong>(co-creator and co-showrunner of 2017’s One Day at a Time)</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl63lmibl006g3b6s8ff6fzns@published>“He was always a stabilizing force”</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl63lmhq7004d3b6seec8miyw@published data-word-count=153>The first time I met him, I remember being in awe, even at that young age of 15, knowing that he was something special. I think it was my fourth callback for the show, and I sat right next to him at this big round table. I remember being very comfortable, which is not usual for those situations because I was really uncomfortable any time I had to go and interview for any show. We read it once and he said, “Well, try it again and do this, that, and the other,” and I was so raw and I didn’t know what I was doing. Now granted, I look a lot like his daughter, Maggie, is what he said, and I think that probably inspired him to give me a chance, knowing how green I was. I guess he saw something in me, and I’m glad he did because he changed my life.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl63lmhq8004e3b6s7wa1v1j3@published data-word-count=162>There was even a point during the first season where he pulled me aside and he said, “Listen, we want to get you an acting coach to bring you out of your shell a little bit.” I had to cry in one of the last episodes, and crying was very uncomfortable for me on camera. Of course, in my brain, all I heard was, You’re terrible. You’re about to be fired. But he really was loving and wanted to help me. He knew that if I could not be so shy and just be more comfortable doing the work that it would be better for the show and it would, in the long run, make me a better actor. Norman said, “We’re gonna find you somebody to help you with the process of what it’s like to try and get to a place of vulnerability and still feel safe.” He really had faith in me when I never had faith in me.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl63lmhq8004f3b6snhpdn97r@published data-word-count=135>As crazy and as horrible as Hollywood can be, I was extremely protected in every sense of the word. It was the kindest place to work. I learned so much and I never ever experienced a casting couch later, and I think a lot of that had to do with being taken under Norman’s wing. He was always a stabilizing force, for sure. When we were out in rough water, Norman would come to grab the steering wheel and calm everything down. He had it all under control in a way that was to protect all of us, starting with who we are, as people, not as a commodity.

I’m 62, so I’m probably older now than Norman was when I met him, which is amazing for me to think about. I was coming right off American Graffiti, and obviously, he knew I had this crazy family. He said, “Mackenzie, America will one day realize this, but I’m gonna tell you this right now: Therapy is the backbone of a healthy family.” I think he was trying to give me some sort of hint, like, you know, “You’re gonna need some.” Certainly, in hindsight, it was an appropriate thing to say.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl63lmhq9004h3b6so7dqc7o7@published data-word-count=80>I remember conversations when we’d all be at the read-through table. We had older men writers — this was 1975 — and they sometimes would write something that they thought was “cool” for a teenager to say. Norman would always say, “Well, Valerie, Mack, if that’s not what a teenager would say, what would you say?” We had that freedom to say those things. There was a lot of give and take but it was always, always a group conversation.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl63lmhqa004i3b6sfag1ttwc@published data-word-count=122>Norman would be there for the first read-through on Monday and then new script pages would come in. They’re different colors — you get pink pages, then blue pages, then you get goldenrod. But midweek, one would come down, and it would be a full script. The cover would be yellow, and in the upper lefthand corner, it would say “Lear Polish,” which meant that Norman himself had taken the script and shined it up. I was always excited when we would get the Lear Polish. And I actually still have — God knows how after my crazy life — all of my scripts from One Day at a Time with my lines marked and “Lear Polish” in the upper lefthand corner.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/259/ae9/1424e8fc60b56ac495730217d6635900a9-norman-secondary.w710.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl63lmhqc004j3b6s1cfwtwxt@published data-word-count=113>We always had a network censor at run-through, and Norman fought them tooth and nail. You were allowed to say “jackass” but you couldn’t say “ass,” and Norman just thought that was ridiculous. He advocated for stuff that wasn’t allowed on TV. We were portraying and representing a very underserved and large portion of the American population — the single mom. To this day, all these years later, I have women, and men, come up to me and say, “You were the only show that represented what my family looked like. You made it okay for me to go to school and be part of a divorced family, living with a single mom.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl63lmhqc004k3b6s197nyosc@published data-word-count=67>Norman had a curiosity about what isn’t being done that should be done, what isn’t being represented that should be represented. I don’t think his goal was to piss people off. Well, maybe it was, knowing Norman. But he wanted to shake things up. He wanted to push the envelope. He wanted to bring a voice to communities that weren’t represented as worthy of having a voice.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl63lmhqg004l3b6sn4nprkqq@published data-word-count=152>Over the years, all through the years of my struggles, whenever I would see him at an event, he would grab me by my face, gently, and say, “That punim, look at that punim! I’ve known you since you’re a baby! I love you.” That friendship was a slow growth because I would see him in passing, and sometimes I would be in a stage of recovery and sometimes I wouldn’t. Now, when I see Norman, I feel as though he has a deep respect and trust and admiration for me, as I do for him. It’s more of two grownups interacting. When I was 40, I still felt like a child around him. I don’t feel like a child around Norman anymore. He saw something in me that I certainly didn’t see in myself.

You’re also very cute, and that’s okay, but you could just never be Charlie’s wife.

He asked if he could show it, and Norman said, “Of course.” It took place in a restaurant, and halfway through, there was a feeling that this was not an amusing or interesting movie. So without anybody saying anything, Carl and Mel took little chairs, put them next to the screen as if they were the next table over to what was on the screen, and sat down and started to ad-lib. Then Norman put a towel over his right shoulder and he became the waiter. They ad-libbed for the rest of the movie, and it was hysterical. I still laugh at it.

He was so ready for anything that was different, new, interesting, and imaginative. The love of life and creativity was there all the time. He used them as a commentary on life.

We laughed a lot together. He found some of the things we did on the show, as per his instructions, so hilarious that he broke up laughing, and I did as well.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl63wfxvu00423b6suf26b4af@published data-word-count=124>With all due respect to our writers and to Norman, none of them had lived or were that terribly conversant with life in the Black community. The mores and values we placed on life and family gatherings and relationships were contrived or misconstrued in the white community. Without any Black writers on staff, we had no representation that could speak with an honest voice about situations that would come up in the everyday life of this family in the community at Cabrini-Green projects. I felt it was up to me and the other actors in the cast to speak up and rectify the situation. I felt very comfortable doing so because I started in television as a comedy writer before I became a performer.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl63wfxvw00433b6se4tw2p9s@published data-word-count=76>I remember him being receptive. For him, it was an educational process. And for us in the cast of&nbsp;Good Times&nbsp;particularly, it was an educational process. We were learning what would fly on television, how to voice your objections or your commendations or your applause or whatever comments we had directed toward Norman’s scripts. We were allowed to do so and say so, so we had complete artistic freedom on the show. That was a rare situation.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl63wfxw200443b6s5oayolfo@published data-word-count=70>We had our differences during the course of&nbsp;Good Times&nbsp;and some of the subsequent shows. We were both very passionate about our respective positions in regards to&nbsp;Good Times. We found that if we became more receptive to other people’s objections or their observations, things would go a lot smoother. In time, we made up our differences, rectified whatever problems we thought we had, and went on to have a good relationship.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl63wfxw200453b6s52zkvgv1@published data-word-count=128>When Norman and I got together again, we did&nbsp;704 Hauser.&nbsp;704&nbsp;was, of course, the Archie Bunker household. I don’t know what possessed me to do it, but I came in one day when we were about to tape the show and I had gotten a severely different haircut. Well, Norman took one look and said, “Oh, no, this will never do. You’re going to buy a wig,&nbsp;and&nbsp;you’re going to pay for it.” And I did. He made me wear the wig in the show so it would match the previous footage of James Evans with his head of hair. That let me know he was adamant about having his characters stay the way they had agreed to portray him and not make changes in the middle of the stream.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl63wfxw300463b6sf7wsuvon@published data-word-count=107>If you knew Norman, you know that when he laid down the law on something, it was laid down. There was no broaching it. We had to do it his way. Because invariably, it was the right way. He was right about that — I don’t know what possessed me to get that haircut that way. I think I was just being recalcitrant. It was another example of working for someone who has strong convictions about his vision as to what he wanted his project to look like, and I had to adhere to his wishes. So it worked out all right. It worked out just fine.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl63wg5m4004t3b6sr8jsf8qu@published data-word-count=77>We got back together again and had a reunion after all those years on his live show. That was the most unusual thing in my career: the fact that I got to play opposite a wonderful actor, Andre Braugher, who was portraying James Evans.

He was able to address issues like teen pregnancy, teen drug use, gangs, and all the subject matter that was virtually ignored on other programs and other networks. He addressed it head-on and did so very, very skillfully and sensitively. I was grateful to be working for someone who was going to use the greatest medium of communication the world has ever known to rectify some of society’s problems — or to attempt to, at any rate. He was courageous in that respect, and his courage paid off by the audiences that gathered for all his shows. —<strong>John Amos&nbsp;</strong>(played James Evans Sr. on&nbsp;Good Times&nbsp;and Ernie Cumberbatch on&nbsp;704 Hauser)</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl63lp1q800do3b6skig2jyd5@published>“He was fully a member of their family”</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl63lmhrk005w3b6suqmcl4qr@published data-word-count=70>I was very intimidated.

He was so, so nice, he seemed really happy and excited that someone in their 20s knew about the show. He told me about the history of the production and said he would love to bring it back one day.

I used to see the words “Created by Norman Lear” so often I didn’t realize he was actually a person, I thought it was just a slogan for TV, like “In God We Trust.” You can look back to Sid Caesar and imagine what television back then must have been like, but with Norman, he’s a living person who can talk to you about the beginning of television.

You can see the look on everybody’s face — first that he even showed up and then that he’s so funny. Throughout the taping, they’re testing jokes, and if a joke doesn’t get a laugh, the writers would huddle to fix the joke.
