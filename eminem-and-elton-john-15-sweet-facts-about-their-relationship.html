Despite Eminem's history of notoriously controversial lyrics, the artists have developed a sweet friendship lasting nearly two decades. It is obvious that the unlikely pair have remained close ever since their collaboration in 2001.</p><p>The rapper and pop legend have been open about their relationship and have made it through the darkest times together. It is clear that they will continue to support each other's journey and be friends for life! We are going to take a look back through the years at the surprising friendship between the two icons. Here are 15 sweet facts about their friendship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=elton-and-eminem-s-friendship-started-in-2001><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Elton And Eminem's Friendship Started In 2001</span></h2><p>Eminem has always been well known to work with many different artists across all genres, one of them being pop legend Sir Elton John. The pair started their friendship in 2001 during the rehearsal for their epic "Stan" performance at the Grammy's that year. During a phone interview between the artists on Interview magazine, Elton remembered that when he first saw Eminem in rehearsal, he got chills up his spine from Eminem's passion.</p><h2 id=elton-had-eminem-s-back><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Elton Had Eminem's Back</span></h2><p>At the time Eminem was receiving considerable backlash for using homophobic lyrics in his music. He told MTV in 2004 "I didn’t know he [Elton] was gay. I didn’t know anything about his personal life. I didn’t really care......But being that he was gay and he had my back, I think it made a statement in itself saying that he understood where I was coming from."</p><h2 id=the-grammy-s-performance-sparked-a-longlife-friendship><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>The Grammy's Performance Sparked A Longlife Friendship</span></h2><p>The icons started their enduring friendship when they performed Eminem’s hit “Stan” at the 2001 Grammy Awards. Eminem appeared on stage along with Elton playing piano and singing the accompanying vocals to Eminem’s verses. It was a really big moment at the time, almost 20 years ago, when the pair seemed...unlikely.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-are-genuinely-happy-to-see-each-other-succeed><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>They Are Genuinely Happy To See Each Other Succeed</span></h2><p>Reuniting at the 2020 Oscars, almost 2 decades later.

During the peak of his addiction to prescription pills, the rap superstar revealed he almost overdosed in 2007. Elton John can obviously easily relate to his friend as he has had his own demons and overcame a cocaine addiction in the '90s.</p><h2 id=eminem-went-to-elton-for-support-and-advice><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Eminem Went To Elton For Support And Advice</span></h2><p>It is important to always have a friend to lean on during hard times.

I reached out to him and told him, 'Look, I'm going through a problem and I need your advice."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=elton-saved-eminem-s-life><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Elton Saved Eminem's Life</span></h2><p>In Eminem’s 2019 biography, “Not Afraid: The Evolution of Eminem,” he admits that&nbsp;before reaching out for help from Elton John he had relapses several times and nearly died of an overdose. The men grew very close through the recovery process, something John can relate to as he has now been clean for over 29 years.</p><h2 id=they-chat-on-the-phone><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>They Chat On The Phone</span></h2><p>In a popular phone interview between the "Rocket Man" singer and the rap legend in 2018, Elton goes on to reveal in the conversation that the pair call each other on the phone and have a good ol' chat from time to time. It is clear the pair like to stay in touch.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Facts Elton John Fans Would Be Surprised To Learn</a></span></p><h2 id=elton-is-a-fan-of-eminem-s-music><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Elton Is A Fan Of Eminem's Music</span></h2><p>In an interview with Beat's 1 host Zane Lowe, the openly gay piano man said, "I listened to the whole of the Marshall Mathers album when I drove to a show in South Hampton and I was floored by it." That is not the first time the 72-year-old has complimented the rapper's music in an interview. It is safe to say that Elton is definitely a fan!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=eminem-gifted-elton-an-inappropriate-gift><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Eminem Gifted Elton An Inappropriate Gift</span></h2><p>During an interview on The Graham Norton Show, Elton revealed that the "lose yourself" singer gifted him and his Canadian civil partner David Furnish an inappropriate diamond-encrusted toy presented on velvet cushions for the couple to enjoy.

You’ve worked so hard on yourself, and no one deserves this more than you, Marshall, and I love you from a long way away, okay?" To which Eminem responds, "Thank you, Elton. I love you, too."</p><h2 id=the-duo-can-relate-easily-to-each-other-s-lifestyles><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>The Duo Can Relate Easily To Each Other's Lifestyles</span></h2><p>It cannot be easy living life in the limelight so we can see how the two became good friends over the course of their careers. In an interview with the Guardian in 2009, Eminem stated "He's [Elton] somebody who's in the business and can identify and relate to the lifestyle and how hectic things can be. He understands."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=eminem-lets-elton-interview-him><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Eminem Lets Elton Interview Him</span></h2><p>It is no secret that Eminem likes his privacy, he does not just take any brand endorsements coming his way or do interviews for just anyone for anything. So it is a true testament of their friendship that Eminem has allowed himself to be interviewed by Elton.</p><h2 id=and-they-mention-each-other-in-the-press><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>And They Mention Each Other In The Press</span></h2><p>The pair still even bring each other up occasionally when they’re talking in interviews or to the press.
