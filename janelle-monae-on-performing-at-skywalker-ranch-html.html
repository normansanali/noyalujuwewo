album, at once captures the X factor of the Atlanta singer: her charismatic presence, her inimitable style, her wild talent. Although her debut, 2010’s <i>The ArchAndroid</i>, was a critical slam dunk (and won her a Grammy nod), that success wasn’t matched in sales. It moved only 186,000 copies. Monáe’s big break, commercially, came a year later with a guest spot on fun.’s runaway hit “We Are Young.” Since then, she’s won the admiration of fellow overachievers such as Prince, Erykah Badu, Miguel — all of whom appear on <i>The Electric Lady</i>. Impressed and envious, Vulture spoke with Monáe about her amazing coterie of collaborators and hanging out at Skywalker Ranch with her fan George Lucas.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e1506ce38dbefd3957c781786ac4c2f8-3-0-0@published data-word-count=130><b>How did you manage to get Prince on your album?</b><br>I’m kind of pinching myself: It’s real. Prince has been a fan of mine since I released <i>Metropolis</i> [her 2007 EP], and he invited me to go out on tour with him. We’ve been really good friends for a while, and he’s been like a mentor to me. It’s really organic for us to work together. I can’t get into details about what that experience was like — I’d want to talk about that down the road. But I will say he was very interesting, full of ideas, and I’m just grateful that he trusted me to guide him in the song [“Givin Em What They Love”]. It was one of the most amazing experiences I’ve had collaborating with an artist.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e1506ce38dbefd3957c781786ac4c2f8-4-0-0@published data-word-count=40><b>Did you see he recently tweeted at you?</b><br>Yeah, he <a href=#>tweeted</a> about <i>The Electric Lady</i> album artwork. I don’t even think he’s even on Twitter anymore. But yeah, it was very hilarious having him on there. [Editor’s note: He’s <a href=#>still there</a>.]</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e1506ce38dbefd3957c781786ac4c2f8-5-0-0@published data-word-count=108><b>Your contemporaries, Miguel and Solange Knowles, also appear on <i>Electric Lady</i>. Do you see them as kindred spirits, switching up what R&B means?</b><br>At first, Miguel and I had a mutual respect and love for one another as artists. I had read that he wanted to work with me for quite some time. Miguel is an incredible producer, too: He did the music [for his album <i>Kaleidoscope Dream</i>] and wrote it and everything. Once I knew that, I was just really impressed. I think where we both want to go with R&B music is not marginalize it, not place limitations on it. Diversify the genre up. Same with Solange.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e1506ce38dbefd3957c781786ac4c2f8-6-0-0@published data-word-count=67><b>How did you meet her?</b><br>I met her at the BET Awards, and we exchanged information. I told her I was a fan of hers. She was a fan of mine. We [connected] pretty immediately. Then my director Al Ferguson, who directed “Many Moons” [her 2008 single], started dating Solange. She’s like family now. We do a lot of work together. There’s just something very special about her.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e1506ce38dbefd3957c781786ac4c2f8-7-0-0@published data-word-count=98><b>How does <i>Electric Lady</i> evolve on the theme of futurism in <i>The ArchAndroid</i>?</b><br>Well, <i>The Electric Lady</i> is kind of a prequel, because it’s more about the love affair between a human and an android [Cindi Mayweather, Monáe’s alterego]. So we think about the ups and downs of that relationship. And how they have to fight for their love and being torn apart. Love, politics, sexuality, religion — these are all things Cindi’s speaking about. She really did help write those songs. So it’s kind of like a prequel of the story of <i>Metropolis</i>, before she became the ArchAndroid.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e1506ce38dbefd3957c781786ac4c2f8-8-0-0@published data-word-count=56><b>What inspired you to write a song about the late female astronaut Sally Ride?</b><br>It was paying homage to her and so many other women who have been marginalized. She became an astronaut during a time when they were not allowing women in space. Sally Ride did something remarkable in an industry that really discriminated against women.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e1506ce38dbefd3957c781786ac4c2f8-9-0-0@published data-word-count=125><b>What works of science fiction most inspire you?</b><br>I love Octavia Butler — she was an African-American science-fiction writer. Also, I’m really inspired, of course, by <i>Metropolis</i>;&nbsp;[Fritz Lang is] the godfather of all science-fiction films. And George Lucas films. When I was little, I had a deep affection for science fiction. I grew up around my grandmother, and that’s where all of my ideas behind science-fiction developed. She and I would always watch <i>Star Trek</i>. As I got older, I started to get into <i>Blade Runner</i> and Ridley Scott movies, <i>The Matrix</i>. I think science fiction is a great way to talk about current issues <i>and</i> the future. There are limitless possibilities, you know? You really get to use your imagination, and you can challenge ideas.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e1506ce38dbefd3957c781786ac4c2f8-10-0-0@published data-word-count=107><b>I read you went to George Lucas’s wedding.</b><br>Yes, I did. Music is the universal language. They [Lucas and now-wife Mellody Hobson] were big fans of mine. His wife actually saw me perform once with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. I filled in for Aretha Franklin. Mellody was in the audience. George Lucas didn’t even know that I was coming to the wedding. When I got there, he was telling me how he’s a fan. He knew about <i>Metropolis</i> and <i>The ArchAndroid</i>. I also got to meet Steven Spielberg, who was there. Talking to both of them was incredible. They really influenced my mind — put ideas in it.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e1506ce38dbefd3957c781786ac4c2f8-11-0-0@published data-word-count=54><b>Who would’ve thought your childhood love of sci-fi would culminate into that day?</b><br>Yeah! Somebody’s watching out for me. I’m very humbled. I never would’ve been able to plan this out: “Hey, you’re going to go to the Skywalker Ranch and perform for George Lucas.” I would have never thought that was going to happen.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e1506ce38dbefd3957c781786ac4c2f8-12-0-0@published data-word-count=122><b>How did dealing with your father’s substance-abuse issues as a kid shape you into the person you are today?</b><br>Well, first, my father is clean. He’s sober. He had hard time. I was able to see firsthand what drugs do. I learned a lot from my dad. I learned how to be resilient, how to not hold on to the past. He’s so much better, and I’m so proud of him: where’s he’s been, where he comes from, and where he is now. And it also made me want to write music. I was really inspired by the highs and lows of life. In this industry, there’s so many highs and lows. So I have to remain balanced, with my head held high.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e1506ce38dbefd3957c781786ac4c2f8-13-0-0@published data-word-count=77><b>You’ve mentioned that you wear suits in homage to your dad and your mom — and anyone else who’s had to wear a uniform to work. Who are your go-to designers to achieve that look?</b><br>I like designers where I can find myself in there, in their collection. Like Chanel — I can always find amazing fabrics. I enjoy Karl Lagerfeld. I enjoy Ralph Lauren — he’s a great American designer. I find a lot in their designs.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e1506ce38dbefd3957c781786ac4c2f8-14-0-0@published data-word-count=43><b>Have you considered starting your own line?</b><br>I’ve thought about it. I look at my uniform as art with a message, paying homage to the working class. It’s walking minimalism art. I keep a dash of color on my nails or on my lips.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e1506ce38dbefd3957c781786ac4c2f8-15-0-0@published data-word-count=52><b>Did you ever go through some mortifying fashion phases?</b><br>Of course, but I’m not really <i>embarrassed</i>. But more like, “Wow, I can’t believe that was me, and I wore my hair like that.” If I love something, I will wear it out. This uniform — it’s transcendent, classic, never goes out of style.</p><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Janelle Monáe on Performing at Skywalker Ranch</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlobGdgbnyrrc2eo6WdXaK8r63EZqanZaCav6e70aagp59dlsFuv8qyrpqkm5q%2Fbr7Ap5qhZpipuq0%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./700045-joey-badass-serayah-montage.html>&#171;&nbsp;Joey Bada$$ Celebrates Serayah With Adorable Montage For National Girlfriends Day</a>
