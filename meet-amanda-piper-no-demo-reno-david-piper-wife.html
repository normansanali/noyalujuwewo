This season, we will again see Jenn, aka The Rambling Redhead, redesign homes for homeowners without any major demolition with the help of her crew. The viewers who have tuned in to watch Season 2 of No Demo Reno might have noticed David Piper, the master carpenter behind some of the incredible transformations in Season 1, is nowhere to be seen now. While we will talk about where we think <a href=#>David Piper</a> is now, the article will be more about his wife, Amanda Piper.</p><h3><strong>Meet No Demo Reno David Piper Wife, Amanda Piper</strong></h3><p>In the first season of the show, viewers of the show loved David’s carpentry skills and charming personality as he helped Jenn renovate plenty of homes without any major demolition.</p><p>Well into Episode 4 of No Demo Reno Season 2, we are yet to see the wonderful David Piper. This has prompted people to question if David Piper is ever gonna return to our screens.</p><p>While there are no signs of David Piper yet on No Demo Reno Season 2, the official David Piper Homes website still says “Check back to hear about Season 2 coming soon!” This means there is still hope, albeit very small, that David could return to the show.</p><p>Usually, David busies himself in his construction business. Whenever he isn’t working, he loves spending time with his wife, Amanda Piper.</p><p>The two reportedly first met each other when David was pretending to be a customer to get a free glass of wine while Amanda was getting a manicure. For that, David was busted and kicked out. At that moment, Amanda realized that something was special about David.</p><p>Furthermore, David courted Amanda for months before they had their first real date. For their first date, they had Mexican food and then honky tonking.</p><p>Amanda and David tied the wedding knots on April 23, 2021. One of Amanda’s closest people, Krista Minarcik Speirs even shared some pictures from their wedding ceremony that same day and captioned it: ‘Today was even more special because we got to celebrate the marriage of the sweetest couple too! Congratulations David and Amanda!’</p><p>In their relationship, David has been described to be the most impatient, sensitive, craziest, loudest, stubborn, and sociable. Whereas, Amanda finds herself a better cook.</p><p>Amanda and David have an enormous age difference (almost 14 years) between them. Amanda was in several relationships before she started seeing David. From one of her previous relationships, Amanda also has a daughter, whose name is Adeline. Adeline was 14 years old as of this writing.</p><h3><strong>Amanda Piper Age</strong></h3><p>Reportedly born in the year 1985, Amanda Piper’s age was either 36 or 37 in 2022.</p><h3><strong>Amanda Piper Job</strong></h3><p>Talking about Amanda Piper’s job, she is a real estate agent by profession.

She helps David with daily duties, which include office tasks and field visits. Amanda’s real estate expertise paired with David’s homebuilding business has produced a team that’s unstoppable.</p><p>Amanda is a member of the Texas Association of Realtors, the National Association of Realtors, the Greater Fort Worth Association of Realtors, NTRREIS Members, and more.</p><p>Coming to her education, Amanda studied at Texas Christian University. She also joined the University of Texas Permian Basin and graduated from there in 2019. Amanda received her real estate license in 2002 from Leonard Hawes School of Real Estate.
