He went on to say, "The Black experience and Black culture are not monolithic, there's no one size fits all shoe. It's ever-evolving and changing with time."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>'Married At First Sight': Are AJ And Stephanie Still Married?</a></span></p><h2 id=ryan-oubre-claims-clara-berghaus-was-disrespectful-to-his-family><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Ryan Oubre Claims Clara Berghaus Was Disrespectful To His Family</span></h2><p>Ryan is a family man and admits that the was taken aback by Clara's conduct in front of his relatives.

"We avoided having these conversations on camera as I knew this was a complex topic and did not want it to seem as I was weaponizing the camera against her.

She complained about every aspect of their intimacy and made it clear that Ryan wasn't a match behind closed bedroom doors.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>'Married At First Sight': Are Myrla And Johnny Really Dating?</a></span></p><h2 id=ryan-lost-trust-in-clara-after-she-aired-their-private-details><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Ryan Lost Trust In Clara After She Aired Their Private Details</span></h2><p>When Clara used the Married At First Sight platform to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">air her bedroom grievances, </a>Ryan felt betrayed.

Most importantly, your kids 100 percent will, and your kids will need you to help navigate it. They’ll need you to help teach, train, and understand as best you can – a systematically racist system. Choosing not to attempt to understand and educate yourself is a red flag.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Married at First Sight’s Clara Berghaus Celebrates Signing Divorce Papers After Ryan Oubre Split</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGipspmeYry2rtGeZJykkaeubq7Eq56hmaWoeq6t0augnpxdlsFussirqq1lo560qcCMnKauqJyaeqW11aipnJ1dmbK1rcilZKudkai8r3s%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./what-did-mini-ladd-do-grooming-allegations-and-controversy-explained-223642-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;What Did Mini Ladd Do?
