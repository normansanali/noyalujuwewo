who had a net worth equal to $6 million at the time of his death (adjusting for inflation).</p><p>Jackie Robinson was born in Cairo, Georgia in January 1919 and passed away in October 1972. He is known for breaking the color line in baseball when he made his Major League Baseball debut for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947. Robinson played for the Dodgers his entire MLB career until 1956 although he started with the Kansas City Monarchs before that. During his career he was a World Series champion in 1955 and a six time All-Star. He was the National League MVP in 1949 and the NL batting champion the same year. Robinson was the MLB Rookie of the Year in 1947 and was a two time NL stolen base leader. His #42 was retired by the Los Angeles Dodgers and has since been retired by all MLB teams. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame on the first ballot in 1962. He was also awarded the Congressional Gold Medal and Presidential Medal of Freedom. Jackie Robinson passed away on October 24, 1972 at 53 years old of a heart attack.</p><p><strong>Salary, Assets and Wealth</strong>: During his career Jackie earned a total of $296,000 in salary. That’s the same as around $2.8 million after adjusting for inflation.</p><p>His first professional salary – $400 per month, came from the Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro American League.</p><p>In 1945 he earned a $3,500 signing bonus and a monthly salary of $600 playing for the Montreal Royals, a Dodgers minor league team. That signing bonus is worth around $50,000 in today’s dollars.</p><p>In 1947 when he made his Major League debut, Jackie’s salary was boosted to $5,000 per year.</p><p>His peak salary of $39,750 came in 1952. That’s the same as earning $380,000 today. At the same time, average white players were making $50,000 per year and Joe DiMaggio was earning $100,000.</p><p>When he retired in 1957, Look Magazine paid him $50,000 for the exclusive rights to his retirement photos. That’s the same as around $450,000 in today’s dollars. After retiring he went to work at snack company Chock Full o’Nuts where he was paid a salary of $50,000 per year.</p><p>At the time of his death, Jackie’s largest asset was his six-acre property in Stamford, Connecticut. Jackie built the estate in 1955. The local country club would not accept him as a member. After his death in 1972 the estate was divided into four lots that were sold off by his heirs one at a time. One of the last remaining lots sold in 2011 for $1.7 million.</p><p><strong>Other Endeavors</strong>: Jackie invested in a clothing store called Jackie Robinson Clothiers that ultimately was not successful.</p><p>In 1963 he founded the Freedom National Bank. The bank was permanently shuttered in 1990 due to financial insolvency.</p><p>Later in the 1960s he founded a construction company, creatively named the Jackie Robinson Construction Company, which specialized in building low income homes and apartments.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKKRmLiqsYyrppuhnqi8r7%2BMp5ytZaekv7W0jJugqJ%2Bilr2pxYycmKudlad6osPAq5usZZaWsLV5wKebZqSZm7Juv9OoqbJn</p></div><div id=links><a href=./jane-seymour.html>&#171;&nbsp;Jane Seymour Net worth, Age: Kids, Bio-Wiki, Husband, Weight</a>
