Perhaps Taylor's dating history is even more popular than her impressive music career.

As <a href=#>fans might already know about Taylor Swift</a>, she's won high-profile endorsement deals with a multitude of companies, sells album after album, and makes a colossal chunk of her income from touring. According to Celebrity Net Worth, Taylor's worth about $400 million. But how do the confirmed past men in her life stack up against this?</p><h2 id=lucas-till---2-million><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Lucas Till - $2 Million</span></h2><p>Among<a href=#> the lesser-known facts about Taylor Swift's love life</a> is her time with Lucas Till. The only dated for a couple of months after co-starring in Taylor's "You Belong With me" music video.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Movie lovers probably recognize this handsome blond from the three X-Men prequels, as well as The Spy Next Door, Battle Los Angeles, and as Travis Brody in Hannah Montana: The Movie. Still, all of these high-profile projects have only earned him about $2 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. While that's nothing to sneeze at, it's nowhere comparable to the other men in Taylor's life.</p><h2 id=conor-kennedy---10-million><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Conor Kennedy - $10 Million</span></h2><p>According to Instyle, the two only dated briefly in 2012 when Taylor was 22 and Conor was 18. For those politically inclined, Conor Kennedy is the grandson of Robert F. Kennedy.</p><p>Apparently, his family wasn't the biggest fans of Taylor after she reportedly crashed the wedding of Conor's cousin. While her reps have denied it, InStyle has laid out some decent evidence of it. Though she and Conor are finished, he'll be fine since he had about $10 million to play around with, according to Celebrity Net Worth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tom-hiddleston---20-million><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Tom Hiddleston - $20 Million</span></h2><p>Tom<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Hiddleston's net worth</a> is almost entirely owed to his role as Loki in the Thor and Avengers movies. But that shouldn't be a surprise to anyone. While he earned a relatively modest salary of $160,000 for the first Thor movie, he was bumped up to $800,000 for the first Avengers. Impressively, he earned $8 million for his less than 15 minutes in Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame. The rest of his income has come from endorsement deals and his various other high-profile projects.</p><p>Hiddleston's romance with T-Swift was well-publicized and didn't last as long as many people predicted.</p><h2 id=joe-jonas---25-million><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Joe Jonas - $25 Million</span></h2><p>While The Jonas Brothers' combined net worth is absolutely massive, Joe's individual net worth doesn't earn him the top spot on this list. He still makes more than his brothers, for those who are interested. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joe Jonas' net worth is somewhere around $25 million</a>, according to Men's Health. And that's without the financial help of his wife, Sophie Turner, who, without a doubt, has some funds due to Game of Thrones, X-Men, and modeling.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taylor Swift And Joe Alwyn Surprise Gigi Hadid On Her Birthday!</a></span></p><p>While Taylor's romance with Joe Jonas was short, it's famous for the 27-second phone call where he dumped her.</p><h2 id=taylor-lautner---40-million><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Taylor Lautner - $40 Million</span></h2><p>According to PopSugar, Taylor and Taylor Lautner met on the set of the film Valentine's Day. The two were together long enough to earn the nickname "Taylor Squared", but that's about all there is to say about it.</p><p>Lautner was once a mega-name in Hollywood thanks to the Twilight series, which is the main reason his net worth is a whopping $40 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. However, he did star in a number of films when he was a kid.</p><h2 id=jake-gyllenhaal---64-million><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Jake Gyllenhaal - $64 Million</span></h2><p>Without a doubt, Jake Gyllenhaal is the biggest movie star that Taylor Swift has dated, sorry, Tom Hiddleston. Gyllenhaal is pure talent, charm, authenticity, and is undeniably handsome. Not only is he a major name in Hollywood thanks to films like Spider-Man: Far From Home, Donnie Darko, and Brokeback Mountain, but it's also exceedingly rich. He's worth about $64 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The couple's 10-year age gap was the main reason they broke-up. But while they were together, they appeared to be inseparable.</p><h2 id=john-mayer---70-million><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>John Mayer - $70 Million</span></h2><p>Who hasn't John Mayer dated? He certainly made an impact on Taylor Swift. According to Instyle, Taylor's troubled relationship with John Mayer was the basis for the song "Dear John". Mayer even wrote a response song, "Paper Dolls". Anyone who knows anything about John Mayer was certain that his relationship with Taylor Swift was meant to be fleeting. But it still received a ton of press.</p><p>While Mayer doesn't have Taylor Swift money, he's reportedly worth around $70 million. This is how he's able to afford $300,000 watches, according to People.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=harry-styles---75-million><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Harry Styles - $75 Million</span></h2><p>Perhaps Taylor's relationship with former One Direction frontman Harry Styles is her most famous. Well, the breakup certainly was. After all, Styles' fans are just as loyal to him as Taylor Swift's fans are to her. Anyone who knows anything about social media culture wasn't surprised by the war that ensued between their fans after their highly-publicized breakup.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taylor Swift’s 10 Most Incredible Career Accomplishments</a></span></p><p>Harry Styles is worth a fortune, to put it simply.

While he can't sing the way she can, he can certainly mix and produce. This has made him one of the world's most well-known and sought-after DJs. According to Celebrity Net Worth, Calvin Harris is worth $240 million.</p><p>Perhaps their combined net worths are why they were able to take so many luxurious holidays together to private islands nobody has ever heard of.
