His stage name is Aidonia, but he is sometimes credited as Idonia. His fast, party-like flow was directly influenced by dancehall reggae from the 1980s and 1990s. After seeing a fight between Beenie Man and Bounty Killer in 1993, Lawrence began to write lyrics. He started giving concerts at school, and he and his friends made a group called J.A.G. 1, also called Jag One Productions or J.O.P. Lawrence lived in New York City for a few years and took part in the city’s dancehall scene in a small way, but he was told to move back to Jamaica and make music as a career. He met Mr. G, who used to be called Goofy, and in 2003 they made their first single, “Many a Dem.” In 2004, he started doing shows every week and made singles for Orize’n Entertainment and Young Blood Records. In 2004, he worked with producer Skatta to record “Lolly,” which became Aidonia’s first big hit. Since then, he’s put out a lot of singles and been on a lot of VP Records and Greensleeves Records compilations. In 2007, the full-length Then and Now came out. Aidonia rhymed over many classic hip-hop and dancehall beats on the mixtape Bolt Action, which was released by Federation Sound in 2009. J.O.P., which is made up of MCs like Deablo, Shokryme, and Tanso, started to work more as a group in the early 2010s. Their hits “All 14” and “Run Road” were big successes.

It breaks our hearts to hear this news. Khalif was well-known on his own in the dance hall. Everything about this loss is bad. King Khalif Lawrence, the son of dancehall performer Aidonia and his wife Kimberly Megan, is said to have died of cancer after a long and brave battle with the disease. Last night, many people who use social media were in a lot of pain because they didn’t know that the couple’s only child was in a very bad way and fighting for his life.</p><p>When he was younger, Khalif was known for being outgoing and full of energy. But in recent years, he has stopped smiling in pictures, making it look like he is just a shell of the person he used to be. Aidonia has a lot of musical talent and has been around for a long time, but when he moved away from the dancehall scene, people made fun of him for being lazy, unreliable, and “losing his juice.” NO ONE KNEW THIS WAS FOR HIS SON. He was putting his life at risk to defend himself while we were making decisions about him. In the process, he gave up his job and his art.</p><h2>Your life and work</h2><p>Aidonia was born Sheldon Aitana Ricardo Lawrence in Kingston, Jamaica. He is the second child of a teacher mother and an ex-soldier father. He got his stage name from the first two letters of his middle name, which is “Aitana,” and a nickname he got while playing football, “Donia.”</p><p>Aidonia went to Mona Heights Primary School and then Meadowbrook High School. Aidonia decided to become a deejay after watching a tape of Sting 1993 with the fight between Beenie Man and his idol Bounty Killer.</p><p>He started acting out the fight for his classmates and friends, writing his own lyrics, and getting together with his friends to form the JAG1 (Jah A Guide) (JOP) crew.</p><p>After being kicked out, he moved with his father to the United States and got a job at FedEx. During the next three years, he went to Jamaica often and did a few “minor” things in the New York City dancehall scene. While he was in New York, some people told him to go back to Jamaica to get his career going.</p><p>He met Mr. G, who was known as Goofy at the time. In October 2003, he recorded his first single, “Many a Dem,” on Goofy’s Young Blood label. Soon after, he started working with Rod Pinnock of Orizen Entertainment.
