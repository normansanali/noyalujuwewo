I find her very beautiful," he stated. However, he had a problem with her political inclinations. "I think she's liberal. She probably doesn’t like Trump," he lamented.

"<strong>She is liberal, or is that just an act?</strong>" he asked the editor during their interview. "She's legitimately liberal? It's not an act? It surprises me that a country star can be successful being liberal."</p><p>Swifties reacted almost instantly, angry with the former president for dragging the singer into a political debate and reducing her to her looks. "You keep Taylor’s name out of your filthy mouth!" <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">a user wrote on X</a>.

"After stoking the fires of white supremacy and racism your entire presidency, you have the nerve to feign moral superiority before threatening violence? 'When the looting starts the shooting starts'??? <strong>We will vote you out in November</strong>," she ranted.</p><p>She also, in 2018, wrote about the midterm elections and implied she regretted not speaking up in 2016.</p><p>"<strong>In the past I’ve been reluctant to publicly voice my political opinions</strong>, but due to several events in my life and in the world in the past two years, I feel very differently about that now. I always have and always will cast my vote based on which candidate will protect and fight for the human rights I believe we all deserve in this country," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">she wrote on Instagram</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I believe in the fight for LGBTQ rights, and that any form of discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender is WRONG. I believe that the systemic racism we still see in this country towards people of color is terrifying, sickening and prevalent."</p><p>Knowing this, it's probably safe to say that, much like her fans, Taylor Swift didn't appreciate Donald Trump's shout-out in his new book.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqsKGWqbamv4yfrKuhn6rAbrDOp5ilnF2pv7a5z2aqrp%2BXmsC1tdWeZJynnaKyr8DSZquasZykv26%2F1qKdrWc%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./100-review-day-trip-season-1-episode-8.html>&#171;&nbsp;The 100 Review: Day Trip (Season 1, Episode 8)</a>
