However, the celebrities on today’s list are doing everything but playing it safe as they tend to go for glittery eyeshadows, holographic lips, patterned eyeliner, and yes — even plenty of face jewels. Honestly, these celebs have it all figured out because at the end of the day makeup should be fun — so why not think out of the box?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a class=bc-title-link title="10 Celebs Who Have Perfected The Art Of The No-Makeup Selfie" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Celebs Who Have Perfected The Art Of The No-Makeup Selfie</a></span></p><p>From musicians such as Dua Lipa and Halsey, over makeup brand owners like Rihanna and Kylie Jenner, to a surprise Hollywood star — keep on scrolling to find out just which celebrities absolutely love playing around with their makeup.</p><h2 id=dua-lipa><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Dua Lipa</span></h2><p>Kicking the list off is British musician Dua Lipa who rose to fame because of her fun pop songs but also because of her bold and funky fashion and makeup choices.
