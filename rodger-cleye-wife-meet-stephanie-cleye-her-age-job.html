Who is she? Are they married still? How many children do they have? What does Stephanie do as a job?</p><p>Read all about it in this article below.</p><h3><strong>Meet Stephanie Cleye, Rodger Cleye Wife</strong></h3><p>Stephanie Cleye is the wife (ex) Rodger Cleye of a prominent TikToker, who is accused of sexual harassment. Rodger and Stephanie shared two children a son and a daughter.</p><p>On Father’s Day 2023, Rodger posted pictures of his kids and captioned the post, “My Beautiful Children. All grown up now. “That’s My Job” by Conway Twitty.”</p><p>Their daughter graduated from Crean Lutheran High School in 2021. However, the name of their children isn’t public yet.</p><p>In 2023, Olivia McCraw, a 19-year-old, accused the content producer of making unwelcome approaches toward her and spoke up about it. Olivia claimed on TikTok that Rodger had flown to her hometown so they could collaborate on a duet. She disclosed that he behaved improperly in their encounter. This involved kissing her and entering the bathroom with the door ajar.</p><p>In the video, she claimed that she kissed the 58-year-old because she was afraid of what may happen if she turned him down because they were alone. He once sent her videos of himself singing in the bathtub, and at one of their dinners, he openly confessed to having a vasectomy, she further revealed.</p><p>Olivia also claimed in the video that Rodger had made her image the wallpaper of his phone. Olivia continued by claiming that after she rejected Cleye, he labeled her a “predator” and a “manipulative little girl” on his second social media account.</p><p>The TikToker is primarily known for uploading covers of well-known pop songs to TikTok, for others who are unfamiliar. Over three million people have seen his videos on the video-sharing website.</p><p>Per his LinkedIn, Rodger worked as a Sr. Electrical Engineer at Lasergraphics after 6 years working at Lear Astronics as Electrical Engineer. Rodger holds a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering from UCLA.</p><p>He also has a <a href=#>YouTube channel</a>.</p><p>It’s also important to note that Rodger Cleye recently used Instagram to respond to claims that he liked McCraw’s older Instagram photographs when she was just 18 or 19 years old. He misrepresented her age by claiming she was 21 while addressing the same.</p><p>In the now-deleted Instagram post, Rodger Cleye additionally added:</p><p>“You should all be ASHAMED of yourself. Last night I went LIVE with a talented 21-year-old Musician and Singer. We sang TO you. We sang FOR you, We sang in a well-lit hotel room and sat in business chairs, We sang in PORTRAIT mode for viewer convenience. The chairs were CLOSE to fit us both in the video. THEN THE RUMORS… “She’s his 19-year-old GF” – WTF? Some sick F dug up a post of her graduate year but failed to imagine that people graduate at different ages for various GOOD reasons. SINGING IS NOT A CRIME AT ANY AGE.”</p><h3><strong>Are Stephanie Cleye And Rodger Cleye Still Married?</strong></h3><p>No, Stephanie Cleye and Rodger Cleye are no longer married. A report from <a href=#>Unicourt</a> suggests that Rodger filed for separation/divorce in November 2021. The docket available suggests that they finalized their divorce in March 2022.</p><p>Now, Rodger has found himself a new girlfriend named Kristen. Their first IG post was in January 2023. He captioned, “Facebook leaked the previous photo. You asked “Who is she?”” In another consecutive post, he wrote, “Meet Kristen. A true angel has entered my life.”</p><h3><strong>Stephanie Cleye Age</strong></h3><p>Born in January 1969, Stephanie Cleye is 54 years old.</p><h3><strong>What Is Stephanie Cleye Maiden Name?</strong></h3><p>The maiden name of Stephanie Cleye is Stephanie Robertson.</p><p>Stephanie is the daughter of Mary and Steve Robertson. Both of her parents reside in Los Alamitos, California. Mary is 74 (September 1948) and Stephen is 75 (December 1947). Her brother Russell Robertson is 52 and resides in Temecula, California.</p><p>Stephanie lost her maternal grandmother Sylvia Bjelde in July 2016. She was 99 years old. She was born January 30, 1917, in Thief River Falls, Minnesota to Oscar and Karen Stavaas. Her parents became Lutheran missionaries and Sylvia grew up in Madagascar with her sister Margaret.</p><p>Sylvia married Sigurd Bjelde in 1944.</p><h3><strong>Stephanie Cleye Job</strong></h3><p>Stephanie Cleye served as a Children’s Ministry Director at the <span class="x193iq5w xeuugli x13faqbe x1vvkbs x1xmvt09 x6prxxf xvq8zen xo1l8bm xi81zsa"><span class=xt0psk2><a class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x6umtig x1b1mbwd xaqea5y xav7gou x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz xt0b8zv xzsf02u x1s688f" tabindex=0 role=link href=#>Presbyterian Church of the Master (PCOM).</a> The church’s Facebook described Stephanie as, “brilliant at helping kids have fun while learning about Jesus, and we’re all about fun and learning here at PCOM.”</span></span></p><p>Stephanie first arrived at the PCOM in 2008.
