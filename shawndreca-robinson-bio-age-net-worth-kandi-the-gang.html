The “No Scrubs” singer made her debut on The Real Housewives of Atlanta on its second-season premiere in July 2009. She has since appeared in five Real Housewives spinoff and companion series, beginning with 2012’s The Kandi Factory, and keeping up with Kandi’s Wedding (2014), Kandi’s Ski Trip (2015), and Xscape: Still Kickin’ It (2017).

So, they claim the southern soul food restaurant to be all about wholesome family traditions. But, in Bravo’s words, this new show aims to shed a light on how tricky it can be to work with family.</p><p>On its very first trailer, the makers featured some delicious dishes and hinted at some even juicier drama.</p><p>Introducing her OLG crew for the very first time Kandi said she can not wait for fans to especially meet her cousin and “ladies’ man” Patrick Dallas, the “extremely handsome” <a href=#>Phillip Frempong</a>, and the “hilarious” BFF duo Shawndreca and Dom’Unique Variety.</p><p>So, one can expect Shawndreca to bring in a fair share of humor on the show. “It is so funny because it wasn’t even intentional”, Kandi, the leading lady, also already said this about her show.</p><p>Now, speaking of Shawndreca, her BIO on Bravo TV says she is the first, and self-proclaimed original hostess at OLG.
