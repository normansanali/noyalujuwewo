First, you fall in love with <a href=#>Olivia’s wardrobe</a>. Then you experience the false sensation that Scandal is never on or is always a rerun. And the third stage, when you start to notice that you recognize everyone on the show from somewhere else. And it’s not just that the actors have popped up somewhere before, it’s that practically everybody involved with Olivia Pope and Associates (with the exception of star Kerry Washington and supporting player Guillermo Díaz) has appeared in at least one show in a very specific and limited set of six, which include The Good Wife, Gilmore Girls, Everwood, and Shonda Rhimes’s previous series. Behold the Overlapping Résumés of Scandal’s cast.

We grouped those shows together because there’s so much overlap between those series as it is. (No one overlaps from <i>Newsroom</i>, as it turns out, but we considered it.)</li><li>Obviously <i>Scandal, Grey’s Anatomy</i>, and <i>Private Practice </i>are all Shonda Rhimes shows and thus share a sensibility.
