One student who survived the shooting gave an account of the gunman. He explained, “He shot the next person’s door. We have a door in the middle. He opened it. He came in and he crouched a little bit and he said, he said, ‘It’s time to die”.</p><p>The shooter reportedly barricaded himself in the classroom and opened fire on the people inside.

According to their family members, they knew each other for more than 25 years and married for 24 years. They were high school sweethearts.

He died there on 5/26/2022.</p><p>Irma and Joe shared four kids; Cristian, 23; Jose, 19; Lyliana, 15; and Alysandra, 12.</p><p>“Their family was an all-American family,” his nephew John Martinez told Washington Post. “They’re great people. The entire family, they’re all great people. They don’t deserve this”. Joe and Irma Garcia’s love story spanned a quarter-century and included barbecues, music, picturesque rural drives, and four children.</p><p>Irma’s cousin Debra Austin said, “I truly believe Joe died of a broken heart, and losing the love of his life of more than 25 years was too much to bear”.</p><p>Joe worked at the H-E-B grocery store and was a leader at his job. He was a long father and a doting husband.</p><p>On Irma’s teacher profile, she had written, “I love to BBQ with my husband, listen to music, and take country cruises to Concan. I have my eldest Cristian son completing Marine boot camp and another son Jose attending Texas State University. <span style=font-size:15px;letter-spacing:-.01em>My eldest daughter Lyliana will be a sophomore in high school and my youngest Alysandra will be a 7th grader this year”.</span></p><h3><strong>Irma Garcia Age At The Time Of Her Death</strong></h3><p>Irma Garcia was 48 years old at the time of her death.
