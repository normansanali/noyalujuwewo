I’m in heaven.”</p><p>Duncan's large frame—6&nbsp;feet 5&nbsp;inches (196&nbsp;cm) and 315 pounds (143&nbsp;kg)—helped him in his jobs digging ditches for Peoples Gas Company and being a bouncer at several Chicago clubs. Duncan also played basketball at Kankakee Community College and for one season for the Alcorn State Braves.</p><p>In 2013, Manigault appeared in the cast of The All-Star Celebrity Apprentice and played in Duncan's honor for his favorite charity and one he had benefited from himself, the Sue Duncan Children's Center. In episode 2 of the season, Manigault won $40,000 for the charity.</p><p>During the week of May 14, 2012, Duncan appeared as a guest on the late night talk show The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson when the show was taping for a week in Scotland. Duncan was one of the show's most frequent guests, appearing a total of 18 times, and, the day after Duncan's death in September, Ferguson began his show with a tribute to him. In January 2013 during The Late Late Show' s winter break, reruns of the Scotland episodes were broadcast with a tribute to Duncan at the beginning of each of the five episodes, featuring Duncan on a pink background and the text "In memory of our friend <a href=#>Michael Clarke</a> Duncan."</p><p>On July 12, 2012, Duncan was taken to Cedars Sinai Medical Center after suffering a heart attack.

Critic Roger Ebert singled out Duncan for praise for his role in The Island, writing that "[Duncan] has only three or four scenes, but they're of central importance, and he brings true horror to them." Duncan appeared in a supporting role in the 2006 comedy Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby as Lucius Washington and, in 2009, Duncan played Balrog in Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li and starred as the titular Cleon "Slammin' " Salmon in Broken Lizard's farce The Slammin' Salmon.</p><p>Famous for his deep, resonant voice, Duncan also did voice roles for films such as Brother Bear (2003) and its sequel, Brother Bear 2 (2006), Kung Fu Panda (2008) and Green Lantern (2011) playing the voice of Kilowog from DC Comics alongside Ryan Reynolds.</p><p>When Duncan was cast as the Kingpin in 2002, he faced the dual challenge of portraying a typically white character and having to gain 40 pounds (18&nbsp;kg) to fit the character's large physique.

When rapper Notorious B.I.G. was killed in 1997, Duncan quit the personal-protection business.</p><p>In 1979, he participated in the Disco Demolition Night at Comiskey Park, home of the Chicago White Sox, where he was among the first 100 people to run onto the field and he slid into third base.
