murder and dozens of other charges related to his death.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">JoAnn Cunningham, 36, and Andrew Freund Sr., 60, of Crystal Lake, appeared separately in McHenry County court, where a judge went over the 30-page indictment handed down Thursday in the death of their son, Andrew "AJ" Freund Jr. A large crowd of people wearing "Justice for

&nbsp;<p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph"><a href=#>The Herald reported</a> that attorneys for Cunningham and Freund, who are each being held in lieu of $5 million bond, requested gag orders in the highly publicized case.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">A&nbsp;<a href=#>41-count indictment obtained by the Herald</a> shows that AJ's parents are accused of beating him repeatedly and forcing him into punishment for hours at a time between Sept. 20 and April 17, when the couple initially claimed they last saw their son. Freund reported AJ missing the following morning, telling a 911 dispatcher the boy vanished sometime after they'd put him to bed.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph"><b>Listen to Andrew Freund Sr.’s 911 call below, courtesy of The Chicago Tribune.</b></p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph"><b><a href=#>Related story: AJ Freund’s parents killed him for soiling himself, hiding it, court documents allege</a></b></p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Officers and deputies from more than a dozen law enforcement agencies spent the next several days searching for AJ, but K-9 units could not find his scent anywhere but inside the family’s home, authorities said.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Cunningham and Freund are also charged with battery for a beating inflicted on AJ on March 4, the aftermath of which Cunningham caught on video, according to police. In the recording, which police officials said was discovered during a search of her cellphone, Cunningham is heard berating a visibly bruised and bandaged AJ for soiling himself.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">According to an arrest affidavit in the case, it was after being confronted with the video that Freund admitted to investigators his son was dead. He led detectives April 24 to a shallow grave near Woodstock where he had buried the boy’s plastic-wrapped body.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">An autopsy determined AJ died of blunt force trauma to the head.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/media-ncd.cmgdigital.com/photo/2019/05/10/1AJ_1557524155010_15260319_ver1.0_320_240.jpg><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">AJ’s 4-year-old brother, Parker, was placed in state custody after AJ was reported missing. Cunningham is pregnant with the couple’s third child.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Cunningham and Freund each face multiple counts of first-degree murder, aggravated battery, reckless conduct, unlawful restraint and child endangerment,&nbsp;<a href=#>according to the indictment</a>. Freund also faces charges of concealment of a homicide in connection with the burial of AJ's body.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Attorneys for both defendants requested Friday that McHenry County Judge Robert Willbrandt impose a gag order on attorneys and investigators involved in the case,&nbsp;<a href=#>the Herald reported</a>. Freund's public defender, Henry Sugden, said his client had already been "tried in the press."</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Wilbrandt declined to rule on the request, asking the lawyers to instead consider a decorum order instead,&nbsp;<a href=#>the newspaper said</a>.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph"><b><a href=#>>> Related story: Slain Illinois boy AJ Freund was beaten, forced into cold shower by parents, prosecutors say</a></b></p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph"><b><i>Editor's note:</i></b><i> The following description of AJ Freund's life and death are graphic and may be difficult for some readers.&nbsp;</i></p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph"><b>‘Maybe Mommy didn’t mean to hurt me’</b></p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph"><a href=#>The arrest affidavit</a>, written by Detective Edwin Maldonado of the McHenry County Sheriff's Office, details the investigation that began when Crystal Lake police officers went to the Freund-Cunningham home, which Maldonado described as being in a "hoarder-like condition." Bags of refuse filled the basement, as well as other portions of the house and the detached garage, the investigator wrote.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Photos from around the time of AJ's birth in 2013,&nbsp;<a href=#>obtained by ABC7 in Chicago</a>, appear to show the dirty and cluttered condition of the home. AJ spent almost the first two years of his life in foster care because he was born with opiates in his system, police said.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph"><b>See the photos below, courtesy of ABC7.</b></p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph"><a href=#>ABC7 also obtained reports</a> of 17 visits to the house by social workers over the five years of AJ's life. The reports document horrid living conditions, concerns over the welfare of AJ and Parker and alleged drug use by the parents, the news station said.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">The Illinois Department of Children and Family Services was last called to the family’s home at 94 Dole Ave. in December, after police were called about a possible burglary there. The responding officer noted deplorable living conditions inside the home, including dog feces and urine all over the house, broken and jagged flooring in the kitchen, a ceiling peeling from water damage and several broken windows.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">She also noted a suspicious bruise on AJ's hip and temporarily removed him and Parker from the home. Police reports said AJ and Cunningham both said the bruise was caused by the family's boxer, Lucy, but&nbsp;<a href=#>CNN reported</a> that AJ told a different story to an emergency room doctor.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">"Maybe someone hit me with a belt," AJ told the doctor,&nbsp;<a href=#>according to a DCFS report obtained by CNN</a>. "Maybe Mommy didn't mean to hurt me.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">The doctor could not definitively determine the cause of the bruise, despite AJ's statements, and the case was closed a month later,&nbsp;<a href=#>the news network said</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cmg-cmg-tv-10030-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/AM5ExqB2zFmJF65qhODbpkuRpwE=/1440x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-cmg.s3.amazonaws.com/public/F3GQEGX7DAFKMPBJQLTT6QMR7I.jpg"><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph"><a href=#>The Daily Herald reported</a> that Marc D.

"The death of a child that was in our care and a family that we were involved with is unacceptable to me and this department. DCFS is currently conducting a comprehensive review of our work with AJ's family."</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph"><a href=#>Maldonado wrote in the affidavit</a> that a check of the Crystal Lake Police Department's database showed numerous previous calls to the family's home, mainly for welfare checks and domestic violence complaints.

Four empty bleach bottles were found in garbage bags and cans around the property.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">A laptop and a roll of duct tape were found in an upstairs closet,&nbsp;<a href=#>the document said</a>.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">During interviews with investigators on April 18, Freund told them he discovered his son was missing when he returned home around 8:30 a.m. from an early morning doctor’s appointment in Elgin, about 15 miles south of Crystal Lake. Police checked with the doctor’s office to see if Freund was being truthful.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">The office staff confirmed Freund’s appointment, but the receptionist who checked him out shared an odd comment the suspect allegedly made.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">"The lawyer in me thinks I need a paper trail," she quoted Freund as saying when she offered him a receipt of his payment,&nbsp;<a href=#>Maldonado wrote</a>.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">When he was initially asked about the shopping list found on his phone, Freund listed the items he bought but left off the gloves and duct tape. He ultimately admitted he bought those items but claimed the gloves were for cleaning and his wife used duct tape to hang photos, the affidavit said.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">When the topic of the "child CPR" search came up, Freund said his wife -- who was seven months pregnant -- may have Googled the topic because of the impending arrival of the baby. When detectives asked why she would need that information after already raising two young sons, Freund had no answer,&nbsp;<a href=#>the affidavit said</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cmg-cmg-tv-10030-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/RZPQunrqyzwQhSm74j5JT_aJq0U=/1440x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-cmg.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IWOJXFCZGLZHHO6ILZQLXLQ5UU.jpg"><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">The topic of the interview then turned to discipline.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">"During the interview, Drew explained that AJ's mother believed AJ had oppositional defiance disorder, ODD,"&nbsp;<a href=#>the document stated</a>. "Drew explained AJ thinks of himself as the leader of the home and therefore, he is defiant to his parents, lies, disobeys and thinks things should go his way."</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Freund admitted that he and Cunningham sometimes locked AJ in his room at night.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Detectives asked Freund about a time when AJ had to be punished in that way. Freund told them about a time AJ was locked in his room for five hours after doing a poor job washing dishes and stacking them improperly. He claimed AJ lied about who stacked the dishes and needed to be punished,&nbsp;<a href=#>the affidavit said</a>.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph"><b>‘AJ fell down the stairs and had a lot of owies’</b></p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Investigators interviewed Parker Freund on April 19, Maldonado wrote.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">The little boy told interviewers that his mother told him AJ "fell down the stairs and had a lot of owies" while Parker was asleep.&nbsp;<a href=#>According to the affidavit</a>, Parker also told authorities he was told by his parents not to talk about AJ.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">The next day, Freund was again brought in for questioning, the affidavit said. The topic of the duct tape again was brought up, and Freund said duct tape could be used for a lot of things.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">One thing he mentioned was taping a Rubbermaid tote shut.&nbsp;<a href=#>Maldonado wrote</a> that he had seen several Rubbermaid totes in the family's basement, including at least two big enough to hold the body of a 5-year-old child.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Neither contained a body, however, and neither had duct tape on them, the investigator wrote.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Further forensic analysis of both Freund's cellphone and Cunningham's phone found text messages and other items that had been deleted.
