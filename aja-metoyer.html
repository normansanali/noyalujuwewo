Wade scored the fewest points in his career in the playoffs that season, averaging 15.9 points per game.</p><p>His time with the Miami Heat was coming to an end as he battled hamstring and other health concerns, so he signed a two-year contract with the Chicago Bulls and made his debut appearance for the team in the 2016-17 season.
