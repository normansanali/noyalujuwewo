He is a former professional basketball player who played in the position of point guard in the NBA. Being tall – 2.01m – and quick, he was taller than most point guards, and was compared with another super player <a href=#>Magic Johnson</a>. Penny Hardaway accumulated the majority of his net worth as a professional basketball player from 1993 to 2007.</p><p>How much is Penny Hardaway net worth? Reportedly, the overall size of his wealth is equal to $50 million. It has been estimated that he earned more than $120 million during his career as a professional basketball player, with his highest salary for one season being $15.75 million, which he received playing for the New York Nicks team in the season of 2005–2006.</p><h3>Penny Hardaway Net Worth $50 Million</h3><p>To begin with, Penny grew up in Memphis with his grandmother, who called him ‘Pretty’, corrupted to Penny, as his mother was usually working and could not take care of the child properly. At first, he was interested in football but this looked too dangerous for the grandma, so he played basketball instead. Penny Hardaway was educated at Treadwell High School where he played basketball managing to make an outstanding average of 36.6 points per game, 10.1 rebounds, 3.9 steals, 6.2 assists and 2.8 blocks. With such results he was named the National High School player of the year by Parade Magazine. Unfortunately, he could not continue his career as during a street assault he was shot in the foot, and had a break for one season. Following his return to college basketball with the Naismith College team, he managed to play successfully and was one of the pretenders to receive the John R. Wooden Award as well as to be named the Player of the Year. He is listed as number five in the top 100 list of point guards who played at college.</p><p>In the 1993 NBA draft he was picked 3rd overall in the first round by the Golden State Warriors team, although Hardaway began his career in the team of Orlando Magic to which he and three other players were traded for <a href=#>Chris Webber</a>. Thus, he has spent the most efficient years with this team which he played from 1993 to 1999, forming a very effective partnership with <a href=#>Shaquille O’Neal</a>. He was then traded to the Phoenix Suns, where he played until 2004, and then from 2004 to 2006, the player belonged to the New York Knicks, and he ended his professional career in the team of the Miami Heat in 2007.</p><p>It should be mentioned that Penny Hardaway represented the USA in the Atlanta Olympic Games in 1996., being a member of the ‘Dream Team’ which won the gold medal. In addition to this, over his entire career he won many awards including NBA Rookie Challenge MVP, NBA All-Rookie First Team, NBA All-Star four times, All-NBA First Team twice and many others which undoubtedly added financially to the total size of Penny Hardaway’s net worth. Overall, Penny played nearly 800 games in the NBA and at international level. E would undoubtedly have played more except for a series of injuries which kept him side-lined for several periods during his potentially peak years.</p><p>Since his retirement, Penny Hardaway has been helping young sportsmen to achieve career highs. Despite his fame and popularity, he coaches young players at middle schools and colleges, having founded his own tutorial program. He is building FastBreak Courts Sportsplex multi-sports arena which will cost $20 million and create more than 230 job positions. It is believed that it will also increase his net worth, too, though Hardaway is doing all this for the sake of promoting sport.</p><p>Concerning his private life, Penny Hardaway is married to Mary McDonnell, and the couple has two daughters and a son.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=19.652154398564><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Penny Hardaway</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$50 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>July 18, 1971</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Memphis, Tennessee USA</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>6 ft 7 in (2.01 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>195 lb (88 kg)</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Profession</td><td>Retired professional basketball player, NBA Player for New York Knicks (2004-2006), Businessman</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Education</td><td>Treadwell High School, University of Memphis</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Mary McDonnell</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Children</td><td>Jayden Hardaway, Latanfernee Hardaway</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Parents</td><td>Fae Hardaway, Eddie Gordon, Fae Hardaway, Eddie Gordon</td></tr><tr readability=0.4><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/iam1cent</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.40909090909091><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.instagram.com/iam1cent/</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.25806451612903><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.imdb.com/name/nm0362040</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.27118644067797><td>Allmusic</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.allmusic.com/artist/penny-hardaway-mn0001248754</a></td></tr><tr readability=7><td>Awards</td><td>NBA All-Star (1995–1998), NBA Rookie Challenge MVP (1994), Great Midwest Player of the Year (1992, 1993), 1996 US Olympic Games Basketball Team (Gold medal)</td></tr><tr readability=11><td>Nominations</td><td>NBA draft: 1993, Golden State Warriors (Round: 1 / Pick: 3), College All-American (1993), Consensus first-team All-American (1993), All-NBA First Team (1995, 1996), All-NBA Third Team (1997), NBA All-Rookie First Team (1994)</td></tr><tr><td>Movies</td><td>Blue Chips, Blue Chips</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>TV Shows</td><td>"This Magic Moment" (2015), "Blue Chips", "VGX Award Show"</td></tr></table><table class=trademarks><tr><th>#</th><th>Trademark</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>His goatee</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=24.755822689707><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=1.6176470588235><td>1</td><td>(February 22) Traded to the Orlando Magic for <a href=#>Steve Francis</a>.
