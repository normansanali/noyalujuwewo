Sooner or later, life kicks in and&nbsp;things get real. That might mean&nbsp;several break-ups and make-ups.</p><p>If <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">new father, Drake</a>, is reading this intro....he knows exactly what we're talking about! Drake and the mother of his child,&nbsp;Sophie Brussaux, have had numerous ups and downs since they initially got together. From public claims to diss tracks, the two have been traveling on a love rollercoaster and they will remain strapped in until the ride comes to a complete stop.</p><p>Keep scrolling to learn everything that we know about their&nbsp;precarious relationship.</p><h2 id=drake-and-brussaux-met-in-january-2017><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Drake And Brussaux Met In January 2017</span></h2><p>The million-dollar question is: 'How/Where did Drake and Sophie Brussaux meet?' Backstage at a concert? On the beach in the Maldives? On the set of a music video? If you guessed any of these, then no $1,000,000 for you...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Actually, the first time Brussaux and Aubrey were seen hanging out was in January of 2017,&nbsp;according to reports.</p><p>The two were spotted at a Japanese restaurant in Amsterdam - they were having dinner with a group of acquaintances. Mind you, Jan 2017 was&nbsp;around the time&nbsp;Drizzy was said to be spending quality time with the ultimate&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">diva, Jennifer Lopez</a>.

He wasn't sure the baby was his at that point in time.</p><p>According to French painter, Sophie, the child was conceived in January 2017....yup, around the same time the pair were first witnessed dining in Amsterdam together. It appears that the"<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hold On, We're Going Home</a>" singer wasted no time putting a bun in Brussaux's oven.

When media reps reached out to the rapper's team, they ostensibly refuted rumors that the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Canadian-born Degrassi star</a>&nbsp;was the father.</p><p>"This woman has a very questionable background. She has admitted to having multiple relationships...She's one of many women claiming he got them pregnant. If it is, in fact, Drake's child, which he does not believe, he would do the right thing by the child", according to Us Weekly.</p><p>The singer's reps went on to clarify that they couldn't authenticate whether the text message swap was legit or not; however, they did note that another hip hop artist who Brussaux got with "all but acknowledged it's his kid."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=in-october-2017-brussaux-gave-birth-to-a-baby-boy><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>In October 2017, Brussaux Gave Birth To A Baby Boy</span></h2><p>Prior to giving birth, Brussaux posted photos of her baby shower with the caption: "Thank you to my AMAZING parents and friends for throwing me the best shower one can ever hope for! Words can't express the depth of my gratitude (for the shower but also your love and support) @aivilo86 @uptownights @valeg23 @lwenaferreira @nivesgadoni1 @davidgvdes + Instragramless beloved ones".</p><p>Soon after, in&nbsp;October of 2017, she delivered&nbsp;a baby boy named&nbsp;Adonis Graham. With bright blue eyes, fair skin, and blonde curly hair,&nbsp;Adonis clearly doesn't&nbsp;resemble his dad too much!&nbsp;The now-2-year-old&nbsp;is 1/4 black and, according to reports, looks a lot like his paternal grandmother.</p><h2 id=drake-took-a-whole-year-to-acknowledge-his-son><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Drake Took A Whole Year To Acknowledge His Son</span></h2><p>It wasn't until nearly a year later that the "God's Plan"&nbsp;rapper acknowledged his son openly.&nbsp;Drizzy&nbsp;emphasized that he kept&nbsp;silent&nbsp;about the situation for so long because he wasn't sure whether&nbsp;Brussaux's son was actually his baby or not — he opted to wait for the&nbsp;findings of a paternity test, prior to going public with the word.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"To be honest with you, I did a DNA test for my son and it came back to us and it said the DNA test got ruined in transit and they couldn’t be 100 percent sure that that was my son or not," Drake expressed in an interview, according to People.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Photos Of Drake Before Fame</a></span></p><h2 id=a-rap-battle-unearthed-drake-s-secret><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>A Rap Battle Unearthed Drake's "Secret"</span></h2><p>In May 2018, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Drake nemesis, Pusha T</a>&nbsp;(from the Clipse) released his third studio&nbsp;LP,&nbsp;Daytona. The album's final song, "Infrared", addressed rumors regarding Drizzy and ghostwriting.&nbsp;Mr. Graham responded by dropping the diss record "Duppy Freestyle"&nbsp;several hours later. The track drew&nbsp;substantial&nbsp;media attention, as well as a reply from Pusha T on social media. Pusha T answered the track four days later by releasing "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Story of Adidon</a>."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On the song, Pusha T exposed Drizzy's hidden offspring: "Sophie knows better as your baby mother, cleaned her up for IG, but the stench is on her; A baby's involved, it's deeper than rap, we talkin' character, let me keep with the facts; You are hiding a child, let that boy come home, deadbeat mothafu**er playin' border patrol, ooh; Adonis is your son, and he deserves more than an Adidas press run, that's real; Love that baby, respect that girl..."</p><h2 id=drake-finally-admitted-brussaux-was-his-baby-s-mother><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Drake Finally Admitted Brussaux Was His Baby's Mother</span></h2><p>After the Pusha T setback, Drake was left with no choice but to address the baby&nbsp;insinuations head-on. "I wasn't hiding my kid from the world/I was hiding the world from my kid," the soon to be 34-year-old noted on "Emotionless". He was, at last, admitting to the world that Brussaux's tyke is, in fact, his.</p><p>When&nbsp;Drake shared&nbsp;pics of his son on Insta for the first time, he literally broke the Internet. Right after Drizzy’s Instagram post, Twitter was packed with images of Adonis, plus viewpoints on his appearance.

"I am a single father learning to communicate with a woman who, we’ve had our moments," the&nbsp;"Toosie Slide" rapper&nbsp;explained.</p><p>"I don’t ever want the world to be angry at his mother.

It's uncertain whether Drake had anything to do with her getting the job, but the move permitted him to be closer to his baby boy.</p><h2 id=drake-amp-brussaux-publicly-celebrated-their-child-s-birthday><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Drake & Brussaux Publicly Celebrated Their Child's Birthday</span></h2><p>In October of 2019, an Instagram post&nbsp;by the "Controlla" singer's divulged that, at his Bridle Path mansion in the 6ix, he commemorated Adonis' second birthday with a party that featured tons of gold birthday balloons.&nbsp;Brussaux also snapped a picture at the shindig, minus Adonis, or his papa. The post was captioned, "A proud, PROUD, birthday mom."</p><p>“Son of my life,” Sophie typed in another Instagram post. “Being your mom is the most beautiful thing in the world. Two years already, my Adonis.” Drake wished his little man well wishes on his birthday&nbsp;as well; “Happy Birthday, King,” the loving father posted.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=drake-disses-brussaux-on-wax><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Drake&nbsp;Disses Brussaux On Wax</span></h2><p>For&nbsp;the majority&nbsp;of 2020, Drake was able to keep his&nbsp;kin out of the hot seat...until two months ago in March, that is. On "When To Say When," a single from Drizzy's album,&nbsp;Dark Lane Demo Tapes, the&nbsp;hitmaker brought up his relations with Brussaux, crooning: "Baby mama fluke, but I love her for who she is."</p><p>According to numerous reports, the Canadian vocalist faced plenty of rebuke for his bars, which presumably threw shade at the mother of his child. The definition of fluke is&nbsp;"an unlikely chance occurrence, especially a surprising piece of luck", according to Page Six; so, is Drake saying that Brussaux got lucky by getting pregnant by him?
