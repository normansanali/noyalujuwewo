Family crisis and a failing career got to him, and he spiraled into a drug abuse habit.</span></p><p><span>However, in 2020, Macaulay stated that his drug days were over. He insisted on not touching drugs anymore as he opened up about his plans to start a family with his girlfriend, Brenda Song, and their three cats.</span></p><p><span>In a candid interview with&nbsp;</span><span>Esquire</span><span>, the Actor admitted he ‘played with Fire’ using drugs but somehow passed his darkest days without checking into rehab.</span></p><p><span>The&nbsp;</span><span>Home Alone</span><span>&nbsp;star said drugs are like his old friends and added, “But sometimes you outgrow your friends.” He shared that he did not do drugs recreationally besides occasional muscle relaxers.</span></p><p><span>The 42-year-old did not have a great childhood. Macaulay said his Father was cruel and violent when he was a kid. He felt his dad was jealous of his career.</span></p><p><span>His parents separated when he was a teenager. He took his parents to court to prevent them from controlling his trust fund, reportedly worth $15 to 20 million. He has been estranged from his Father ever since.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=macaulay-culkin-was-arrested-for-drugs></span><span>Macaulay Culkin Was Arrested For Drugs</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Macaulay Culkin is not currently under arrest. He claims to be past his drug years. But in 2004, when Macaulay was 24, his mugshot made headlines worldwide.</span></p><p><span>After Police officers searched his car in Oklahoma City in September 2004, he was charged with possessing marijuana and two controlled substances, Alprazolam and Clonazepam, without a prescription.</span></p><p><span>He was briefly jailed and later released on $4,000 bail. After appearing in court for misdemeanor drug offenses, he initially pleaded not guilty but later reversed the plea to guilty.</span></p><p><span>Macaulay then received three one-year suspended prison sentences and $540 fees.</span></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=learn-about-macaulay-culkin-family-and-love-life></span><span>Learn About Macaulay Culkin Family And Love Life</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><span>Macaulay Carson Culkin was born in New York City to his parents, Christopher Cornelius “Kit” Culkin and Patricia Brentrup.
