class=mol-para-with-font>It was at the university in 1983 that he heard the IRA’s gunshots which killed his fellow law professor and UUP colleague Edgar Graham and later identified the body.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He left academia for politics full time when he was elected as MP for Upper Bann following a by election in 1990 after the death of the incumbent Harold McCusker.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Lord Trimble rose to prominence partly due to the Drumcree dispute as nationalist residents opposed the procession of an orange parade along the Garvaghy Road.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He led the parade along the road in 1995, famously joining hands with Democratic Unionist leader Ian Paisley.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A few months later, Lord Trimble unexpectedly won the leadership of the Ulster Unionist Party over the favourite Lord Kilclooney, starting his often turbulent time at the helm of the party.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He marked a number of firsts as Ulster Unionist leader, including becoming the party’s first leader in 30 years to meet with the Irish premier in Dublin and in 1997 he became the first unionist leader since partition to negotiate with Sinn Fein.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The peace talks, which started formally in 1998 under the chairmanship of former US senator George Mitchell, saw many nights of intensive negotiation pressed on by then prime minister Tony Blair, taoiseach Bertie Ahern and then US president Bill Clinton.</p><img decoding=async id=i-35b1f2d77c55c22d

class=mol-para-with-font>The process faltered several times but perhaps most notably when then Ulster Unionist Jeffrey Donaldson walked out of the talks.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>However on April 10, 1998, the agreement was signed, and endorsed following a referendum held the following month.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Lord Trimble become the first first minister of Northern Ireland

men, with the issue of the paramilitary groups decommissioning overshadowing Stormont.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Lord Trimble also struggled with internal divisions within his party which saw Mr Donaldson, along with fellow future DUP leader Arlene Foster and Norah Beare, resigning in December 2003.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Lord Trimble lost his Westminster seat in Upper Bann at the 2005 election to DUP candidate David Simpson.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He resigned as leader of the party whose once dominant Westminster representation had been reduced to just one seat.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He was made a life peer the following year and later took up his seat in the House of Lords as a member of the Conservative Party to have, he said, great influence on UK politics.</p><img decoding=async id=i-c454300c030a9e2f src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/07/25/20/60679691-11047355-image-a-29_1658775688292.jpg height=461 width=634

Colin Davidson at the Queen’s University.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He then reflected on the approach of the 25th anniversary of the Belfast Agreement, and pointed out it has survived despite the objections.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘The Good Friday Agreement is something which everybody in Northern Ireland has been able to agree with, it doesn’t mean they agree with everything, there are aspects which some people thought were a mistake, but the basic thing is that this was agreed, he said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘That is there.
