But Netflix powered through amid the distrust and rumors, only for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rolling Stone</a> to, well pardon my pun, roll out a sensational expose claiming that the game was fixed, with particular contestants already chosen to make it to the end and that the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">big crowd of 456 participants</a> was just for show.</p><h2 id=h-what-have-the-former-contestants-said-about-the-netflix-reality-show data-injectable=false>What have the former contestants said about the Netflix reality show?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Squid-Game-The-Challenge-1-1-1.jpg><p data-characters=401 data-current-count=701 data-injectable=true>Not only did the report double down on previous allegations that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the show was filmed under inhumane conditions</a> — from contestants left to spend nine hours in freezing conditions to those in dire need of medical help not receiving any immediately as the producers didn’t want to ruin the shot — but former players also shared with the publication that the game was rigged from the very beginning.</p><p data-characters=575 data-current-count=575 data-injectable=true>The former players shared many details with Rolling Stone — including how the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok and Instagram influencers</a> were “pre-selected,” which included them having fully functioning mics, moving when they were supposed to be frozen, getting extra time to make it to the finish line, and making it to the next round even when they failed the first one, while many of those eliminated were given fake microphones and were either deliberately failed or removed despite winning. One of them even alleged seeing an eliminated player returning to the game without any explanation.</p><p>“It really wasn’t a game show. It was a TV show, and we were basically extras in a TV show.”</p><p data-characters=244 data-current-count=345 data-injectable=false>In fact, two of the eliminated contestants discovered when they first reached London that their return flights were already booked — before they even got a chance to play the game, or as they called it, the “Rigged Game” by “Net Fix.”</p><h2 id=h-how-true-are-these-allegations-against-squid-game-the-challenge data-injectable=false>How true are these allegations against Squid Game: The Challenge?</h2><p data-characters=303 data-current-count=648 data-injectable=true>There is yet to be concrete evidence to confirm either side of this argument. However, further flames have been fueled by a few eliminated contestants once again making fresh claims — this time on social media — that the show was pre-decided to go in a set direction with already chosen contestants.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Ashley Yoder (@spidermonkeyyoda)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=415 data-current-count=715 data-injectable=true>Whether it is Ashley Yoder (contestant 332) accusing the show of treating its non-preferred cast “really bad” or contestant 299, Spencer Hawkins, sharing on his TikTok how in the Dalgon cookie game only one-fourth of the participants were actively working as the rest were instructed to merely pretend that they were also working on a cookie, Squid Game: The Challenge’s reputation has definitely taken a hit.</p><h2 id=h-has-netflix-and-squid-game-the-challenge-creators-responded-to-accusations-of-the-show-being-fake-and-rigged data-injectable=false>Has Netflix and Squid Game: The Challenge creators responded to accusations of the show being fake and rigged?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Squid-Game-The-Challenge-2-1.jpg><p data-characters=240 data-current-count=540 data-injectable=true>Similar claims made previously were labeled “untrue” by Netflix and the co-producing studios The Garden and Studio Lambert, who assured that an independent adjudicator was present during each and every game to ensure its fairness.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=391 data-current-count=391 data-injectable=false>Now, the outright allegations are yet to be addressed, but in a chat with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, the show’s producers did respond to the possibility that certain aspects of the show may appear staged because they fictionalized certain elements — like showing the hours-long Red Light, Green Light in just five minutes and putting masked men between the player to “control” the game.</p><p>“We made that judgment. If somebody else was making it, they might have made a different judgment call. We think it works for us. People expect the show to be quite like the scripted show. I think the use of the guards was something we are very pleased with — they helped build that sense of it being an immersive experience for the contestants. They did a lot of the communicating of the information to the players, rather than having producers doing it, or having a host. And they looked good.”</p><p data-characters=469 data-current-count=469 data-injectable=false>Well, now, that doesn’t really answer whether the decision to stage and fictionalize certain sections also extended to deciding <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">who will make it to the end of the show</a>. Apart from waiting for Netflix to issue another statement refuting the claims, we can only expect more contestants to support either side of the claim — there are 456 of them after all, and even a quarter of them supporting or going against the above allegations could be enough to seal the deal.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yqv4ysqK6hlGK0ornEZquhnV2YtaK4y56loJ1dqLCztc%2BtnJ1n</p></div><div id=links><a href=./young-sheldon-actually-filmed-east-texas.html>&#171;&nbsp;Is Young Sheldon Actually Filmed in East Texas?
